Hi, let me introduce myself. I'm Suki, and this year I'm going to
do some AoC (Advent of Code) riddles to better my coding skills.
I've decided to start at the beginning, 2015 - let's see how far I make it
in 2025.
First day, and I'm today the main struggle seems to be the setup.
I'm working on VSCode, and my main experience is with Frontend frameworks,
vue, React.
So, how the heck do I set up an environment that can read a file without all
of the magic that is part of the projects I've worked on so far? (All set up
by somebody else). What do I need?
Is it necessary to have a package.json and a package-lock.json?
Do I need to install any modules?
What's with all these file extensions?
I've been trying randomly and I've been getting funny errors, such as
"Unexpected token `export`". All that tells me is that my setup is wrong.

Now, I could use the setup I got from a friend. It works fine, but it also feels
a little bit like cheating. I've been told there was a simple way to just "read"
the file, so that's what I've been trying to do. But I might have to ask for some
more help on that one.
